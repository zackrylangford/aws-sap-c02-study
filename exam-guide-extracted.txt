Exam content
Response types
The exam contains one or more of the following question types:
•

Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses
(distractors).

•

Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more
response options. You must select all the correct responses to receive credit for
the question.

Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect. There is no penalty for guessing. The
exam includes 65 questions that affect your score.
Unscored content
The exam includes 10 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects
information about performance on these unscored questions to evaluate them for
future use as scored questions. The unscored questions are not identified on the exam.
Exam results
The AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional (SAP-C02) exam has a pass or fail
designation. The exam is scored against a minimum standard established by AWS
professionals who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines.
Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum
passing score is 750. Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole
and whether you passed. Scaled scoring models help equate scores across multiple
exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels.
Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each
section level. The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do
not need to achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overall
exam.
Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more
questions than other sections have. The table of classifications contains general
information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when you
interpret section-level feedback.

Mentions of AWS services on the exam
AWS Certification is reducing the reading load on this exam by using official short
names for well-known AWS service names that contain abbreviations or parenthetical
information. For example, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) appears
on the exam as Amazon SNS.
The Help feature in the exam (available for every question) contains the list of the
short AWS service names and their corresponding full names.
You can consult AWS Service Names on the AWS Certification website for the list of
services that appear as their short names on the exam. Any services that are on the
list but that are out of scope for the exam will not appear on the exam.
Note: Not every abbreviation is fully spelled out on the exam or available in the Help
feature. The official full name for some AWS services includes an abbreviation that is
never expanded (for example, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon EMR). The exam also
might contain other abbreviations that the target audience is expected to know.
